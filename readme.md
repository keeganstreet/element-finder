# Element Finder

Find in Files with CSS selectors.

Element Finder is a command line app for recursively searching through a directory and finding HTML files which contain elements matching a given CSS selector. The app is built with Node JS and uses [Sizzle](http://sizzlejs.com/) as the selector engine - the same selector engine used by jQuery.


## Example usage

Search for elements with a class of `awesome-list`:

    elfinder -s .awesome-list

Search for elements with a class of `awesome-list` which are descendants of an element with a class of `colours`:

    elfinder -s ".colours .awesome-list"

Search for elements with a class of `awesome-list` in files with an extension of `html` or `shtml`:

    elfinder -s .awesome-list -x "html, shtml"

Search for elements matching the `ul.boxes .box` selector, but ignore any files in the `.git`, `.svn` or `partials` folders:

    elfinder -s "ul.boxes .box" -i ".git, .svn, partials"


## Installation with npm (recommended)

1. Install Node JS: http://nodejs.org/#download

2. Install elfinder globally with npm (npm comes with Node JS):

        npm install -g elfinder

Element Finder is a command line tool so it is best to install in globally with npm.


## Manual installation (Mac OSX)

1. Install Node JS: http://nodejs.org/#download

2. Get the Element Finder source. Download it or clone it from GitHub: https://github.com/keeganstreet/element-finder

3. CD into the element-finder directory

4. Install the dependencies with npm (npm comes with Node JS):

        npm install

5. Make the element-finder.js script exectutable:

        chmod +x element-finder.js

6. Add a symlink to the element-finder.js script from a directory in your PATH:

    6.1. Check what your path variable is set to:

        echo $PATH

    6.2. Check that /usr/local/bin is in your path. If not:

        sudo mkdir /usr/local/bin

    6.3. Assuming that /usr/local/bin is present in your PATH, create a link from there to element-finder.js

        ln -s "/Users/kestreet/Dropbox/Projects/element-finder/element-finder.js" /usr/local/bin/elfinder

7. Crack open a beer.


## Manual installation (Windows)

Note: The first two steps are included because one of Element Finder's dependencies, [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom), requires Python and Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 to compile.

1. Install [Python 2.7](http://www.python.org/getit/releases/2.7.3/).

2. Install [Microsoft Visual C++ 2010](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/visual-cpp-express).

3. Install Node JS: http://nodejs.org/#download

4. Get the Element Finder source. Download it or clone it from GitHub: https://github.com/keeganstreet/element-finder

5. CD into the element-finder directory

6. Install the dependencies with npm (npm comes with Node JS):

        npm install
		
	Note: If this step fails and the error message mentions JSDom or Contextify, the instructions for [Installing JSDom on Windows](http://www.steveworkman.com/node-js/2012/installing-jsdom-on-windows/) may help.

7. I don't know of a way of making specific JavaScript files like element-finder.js executable on Windows, so to run Element Finder on Windows, you will need to follow these steps:

	7.1. CD into the directory you want to search.
	
	7.2. Tell Node to run element-finder.js:
	
		node c:\path\to\element-finder.js -s ".awesome-list"


## Errors you might encounter

### -bash: elfinder: command not found

Have you created the symlink properly? Run `open /usr/local/bin/` and see if the `elfinder` link opens the `element-finder.js` script.
